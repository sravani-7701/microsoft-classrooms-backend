* I categorized my sprints into four sections - exploration, basic working model, features creation, adapt phase.
* We were given a problem statement in which we had to make a app of platform that would help student
 So I planned to build the most important features for students joining a call, Tasks app,Assignments, File Sharing and Discussion tab
* In the first week,I designed the plan,decided the techstack , learnt the socket.io and developed the calls featue and chat feature
